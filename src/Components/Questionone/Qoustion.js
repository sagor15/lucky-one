            <h1>1. How react works?</h1>
            <p>React is the most popular JavaScript library in the modern technology. Using react we can build single page application and mobile apps.
To show something in the app, react works in declarative code. Declarative code is lightweight, easier to understand. It creats componenets which is how we display information in fragmentation. There are 2 types of components 1. Functional components, 2. Class components. Components are made of two main ingredients: state and props. These makes react code structure like a tree. component tree allows us to create complex UIs. React works in unidirectional way. That means it can pass data from parent to child element. As a handy and helpful technology the react is, developer likes to go with react instead of Angular.
React save developers time and helps to create awesome app. It doesn't need code much.</p>
